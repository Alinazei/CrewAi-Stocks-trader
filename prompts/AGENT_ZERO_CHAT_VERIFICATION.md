# Task 5: Trading Decision - CORRECT API USAGE
trading_task = Task(
    description=f"""
    Based on all previous analysis (market, news, risk, portfolio), make trading decisions:
    
    **CORRECT ORDER SIDES (StocksTrader API):**
    - 'buy' = open long position (bet on price increase)
    - 'sell' = open short position (bet on price decrease) 
    - 'sell_short' = open short position (explicit short selling)
    - 'buy_to_cover' = close short position
    
    **POSITION CLOSING:**
    - Use close_position(deal_id) to close any position
    - DO NOT use order sides to close positions
    
    Make specific recommendations with proper order sides and pass decisions to 
    Order Management Leader for execution coordination.
