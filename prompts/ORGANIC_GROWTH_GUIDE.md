• Timestamp for evolution tracking
```

### **2. Pattern Recognition**
Agents automatically discover successful strategies:

```
🔍 Pattern Discovery:
• Minimum 3 similar experiences required
• 70%+ success rate threshold
• Market condition matching
• Confidence scoring based on frequency
• Automatic pattern application
```

### **3. Personality Evolution**
Agent personalities adapt based on performance:

```
🎭 Adaptive Traits:
• Risk Tolerance (adjusts based on success/failure)
• Decision Speed (faster with experience)
• Confidence Threshold (self-calibrating)
• Specializations (strengthens successful areas)
• Preferred Strategies (evolves with market conditions)
