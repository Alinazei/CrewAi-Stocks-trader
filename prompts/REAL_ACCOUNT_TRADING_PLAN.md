## 📊 **PHASE 1: PRE-TRADING SETUP & RISK MANAGEMENT**

### **1.1 Account Configuration**
- **Broker**: StocksTrader Real Account
- **Account Type**: Live Trading Account
- **Risk Tolerance**: Conservative (1-2% per trade)
- **Maximum Portfolio Risk**: 10% total portfolio
- **Position Sizing**: Based on account balance and volatility

### **1.2 Risk Management Protocols**
```
📋 RISK MANAGEMENT RULES:
• Maximum Risk Per Trade: 2% of account balance
• Maximum Portfolio Risk: 10% of total portfolio
• Stop Loss: Always set (3-5% from entry)
• Take Profit: 2:1 or 3:1 risk-reward ratio
• Maximum Open Positions: 5 concurrent trades
• Daily Loss Limit: 5% of account balance
• Weekly Loss Limit: 15% of account balance
```

### **1.3 Position Sizing Calculator**
```
POSITION SIZE = (Account Balance × Risk Per Trade) ÷ Stop Loss Distance

Example:
• Account: $10,000
• Risk: 2% = $200
• Stop Loss: 4% = $2.40 (for $60 stock)
• Position Size: $200 ÷ $2.40 = 83 shares
• Total Investment: 83 × $60 = $4,980
